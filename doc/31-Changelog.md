## 1.1.0 (2020-06-02)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/4?closed=1)

### Notes

* [#62](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/62) Deprecates `--key` argument for certificate generation for Icinga 2.12.0 and later

### Deprecations

* The value `latest` for the installation wizard argument `AgentVersion` is deprecated and has been replaced by `release`

### Breaking changes

* The `-AcceptConnections` argument for the install wizard had the opposite effect in the previous versions. Please review your configuration on a test setup before proceeding with a mass-rollout to ensure the Agent behaves as expected
* The wizard now ships with a new argument `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig` which will convert hostnames or FQDN entries for connection information to IP addresses. If you are having a CLI string available and neither want to be asked this question or change current behaviour, set the argument to 0: `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig 0`

* Console prints are now containing a severity message to better keep an eye on possible warnings/errors
* [#69](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/69) Improves stability of installation/uninstallation of the Agent by using different PowerShell instances for service and installation/uninstallation handling

### Bugfixes

* [#61](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/61) Fixes duplicate command line entries after wizard completion and escaping of values
* [#63](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/63) Adds missing port argument for certificate generation requests
